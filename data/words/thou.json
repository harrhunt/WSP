This has not always been the case. In Old English and Middle English, some of these different functions of you were supplied by different words. Thus, thou was at one time the singular subjective case (thou art a beast), while thee was the singular objective case (he cares not for thee). In addition, the form thy (modern equivalent your) was the singular possessive determiner, and thine (modern equivalent yours) the singular possessive pronoun, both corresponding to thee. The forms you and ye, on the other hand, were at one time reserved for plural uses. By the 19th century, these forms were universal in standard English for both singular and plural, polite and familiar. In present day use, thou, thee, thy, and thine survive in certain religious groups and in some traditional British dialects, but otherwise are found only in archaic contexts", "type": "editorialNote"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "T\u035fHou"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/thou_us_1.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u00f0a\u028a"}], "senses": [{"crossReferenceMarkers": ["archaic or dialect form of you, as the singular subject of a verb", "Compare with thee"], "crossReferences": [{"id": "you", "text": "you", "type": "see also"}, {"id": "thee", "text": "thee", "type": "see also"}], "examples": [{"text": "thou art fair, O my beloved"}], "id": "m_en_gbus1049120.005"}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "pronoun", "text": "Pronoun"}, "text": "thou"}], "type": "headword", "word": "thou"}, {"id": "thou", "language": "en-us", "lexicalEntries": [{"entries": [{"etymologies": ["mid 19th century: abbreviation"], "homographNumber": "200", "inflections": [{"grammaticalFeatures": [{"id": "plural", "text": "Plural", "type": "Number"}], "inflectedForm": "thou"}, {"grammaticalFeatures": [{"id": "plural", "text": "Plural", "type": "Number"}], "inflectedForm": "thous"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "THou"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/thou_us_2.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u03b8a\u028a"}], "senses": [{"definitions": ["a thousand"], "examples": [{"text": "two hundred thou"}], "id": "m_en_gbus1049130.005", "registers": [{"id": "informal", "text": "Informal"}], "semanticClasses": [{"id": "numeric_value", "text": "Numeric_Value"}], "shortDefinitions": ["thousand"], "subsenses": [{"definitions": ["one thousandth of an inch."], "domainClasses": [{"id": "measure", "text": "Measure"}], "id": "m_en_gbus1049130.009", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "linear_unit", "text": "Linear_Unit"}], "shortDefinitions": ["one thousandth of inch"]}]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "thou"}], "type": "headword", "word": "thou"}], "word": "thou"}
