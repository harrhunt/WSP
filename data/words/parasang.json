It was reckoned by Herodotus, and apparently also by Xenophon, to be equal to 30 stadia, which, taking the Persian stadium as approx. 198 m (650 feet), would make the parasang approx. 5.9 km (3.7 miles). This, however, would only apply to cavalry; for foot soldiers the distance would be approx. 4 km (2.5 miles). According to Pliny and Strabo the length of the parasang was reckoned differently by different authors, some making it equal to 40 or even 60 stadia.", "type": "technicalNote"}], "registers": [{"id": "historical", "text": "Historical"}]}, {"definitions": ["Figurative and in extended use."], "id": "m_en_gb_oed137620.007", "registers": [{"id": "historical", "text": "Historical"}]}]}], "language": "en-gb", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "parasang"}], "type": "headword", "word": "parasang"}], "word": "parasang"}
