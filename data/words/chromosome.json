Their number varies from species to species: humans have 22 pairs plus the two sex chromosomes (two X chromosomes in females, one X and one Y in males). During cell division, each DNA strand is duplicated, and the chromosomes condense to become visible as distinct pairs of chromatids joined at the centromere. Bacteria and viruses lack a nucleus and have a single chromosome without histones", "type": "encyclopedicNote"}], "semanticClasses": [{"id": "gene", "text": "Gene"}], "shortDefinitions": ["structure of nucleic acids and protein"]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "chromosome"}], "type": "headword", "word": "chromosome"}], "word": "chromosome"}
