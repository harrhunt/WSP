The reason for this is that former and latter were formed as comparatives, and comparatives are correctly used with reference to just two things, while a superlative is used where there are more than two things. (So, for example, strictly speaking one should say the longest of the three books but the longer of the two books.) In practice, former and latter are now sometimes used just as synonyms for first and last and are routinely used to refer to a contrast involving more than two items. Such uses, however, are not acceptable in good English style. Therefore, if you're referring to winter, spring, and summer, for example, it would be correct to say I find the last most enjoyable, not I find the latter most enjoyable", "type": "editorialNote"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8f\u00f4rm\u0259r"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/former_us_1.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8f\u0254rm\u0259r"}], "senses": [{"definitions": ["having previously filled a particular role or been a particular thing"], "examples": [{"text": "her former boyfriend"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0382200.006", "shortDefinitions": ["having previously been particular thing"], "subsenses": [{"definitions": ["of or occurring in the past or an earlier period"], "examples": [{"text": "in former times"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0382200.008", "shortDefinitions": ["of or occurring in past"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "earlier"}, {"language": "en", "text": "old"}, {"language": "en", "text": "past"}, {"language": "en", "text": "bygone"}, {"language": "en", "text": "long-ago"}, {"language": "en", "text": "forgotten"}, {"language": "en", "text": "immemorial"}, {"language": "en", "text": "remote"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "former", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0005966.002"}]}], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "one-time"}, {"language": "en", "text": "erstwhile"}, {"language": "en", "text": "sometime"}, {"language": "en", "text": "late"}, {"language": "en", "text": "as was"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "former", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0005966.001"}]}, {"definitions": ["denoting the first or first mentioned of two people or things"], "examples": [{"notes": [{"text": "as noun", "type": "grammaticalNote"}], "text": "the powers of the former are more comprehensive than those of the latter"}, {"text": "those who take the former view"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0382200.010", "notes": [{"text": "\"the former\"", "type": "wordFormNote"}], "shortDefinitions": ["denoting first or first mentioned of two people or things"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "first-mentioned"}, {"language": "en", "text": "first"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "former", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0005966.003"}]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "adjective", "text": "Adjective"}, "text": "former"}], "type": "headword", "word": "former"}, {"id": "former", "language": "en-us", "lexicalEntries": [{"entries": [{"homographNumber": "200", "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8f\u00f4rm\u0259r"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/former_us_1.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8f\u0254rm\u0259r"}], "senses": [{"definitions": ["a person or thing that forms something"], "examples": [{"notes": [{"text": "in combination", "type": "grammaticalNote"}], "text": "an opinion-former"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0382210.006", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "unspecified_thing", "text": "Unspecified_Thing"}], "shortDefinitions": ["person or thing that forms something"], "subsenses": [{"definitions": ["a transverse strengthening part in an aircraft wing or fuselage."], "domainClasses": [{"id": "aviation", "text": "Aviation"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0382210.010", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "aircraft_part", "text": "Aircraft_Part"}], "shortDefinitions": ["strengthening part in aircraft wing"]}]}, {"definitions": ["a person in a particular school year"], "domainClasses": [{"id": "education", "text": "Education"}], "examples": [{"text": "fifth-formers"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0382210.013", "notes": [{"text": "in combination", "type": "grammaticalNote"}], "regions": [{"id": "british", "text": "British"}], "semanticClasses": [{"id": "person", "text": "Person"}], "shortDefinitions": ["person in particular school year"]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "former"}], "type": "headword", "word": "former"}], "word": "former"}
