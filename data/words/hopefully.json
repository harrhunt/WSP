In the second half of the 20th century a new use as a sentence adverb became established, meaning \u2018it is to be hoped that,\u2019 as in hopefully, we'll see you tomorrow. This second use is now much more common than the first use, but it is still believed by some people to be incorrect. Why should this be? People do not criticize other sentence adverbs, e.g. sadly (as in sadly, her father died last year) or fortunately (as in fortunately, he recovered). Part of the reason is that hopefully is a rather odd sentence adverb: while many others, such as sadly, regrettably, and clearly, may be paraphrased as \u2018it is sad/regrettable/clear that \u2026\u2019, this is not possible with hopefully. Nevertheless, it is clear that use of hopefully has become a shibboleth of \u2018correctness\u2019 in the language\u2014even if the arguments on which this is based are not particularly strong\u2014and it is wise to be aware of this in formal contexts.
