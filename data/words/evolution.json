Lamarck proposed a theory that organisms became transformed by their efforts to respond to the demands of their environment, but he was unable to explain a mechanism for this. Lyell demonstrated that geological deposits were the cumulative product of slow processes over vast ages. This helped Darwin toward a theory of gradual evolution over a long period by the natural selection of those varieties of an organism slightly better adapted to the environment and hence more likely to produce descendants. Combined with the later discoveries of the cellular and molecular basis of genetics, Darwin's theory of evolution has, with some modification, become the dominant unifying concept of modern biology", "type": "encyclopedicNote"}], "semanticClasses": [{"id": "evolutionary_process", "text": "Evolutionary_Process"}], "shortDefinitions": ["development of organisms from earlier forms"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "Darwinism"}, {"language": "en", "text": "natural selection"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "evolution", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0005144.002"}]}, {"definitions": ["the gradual development of something, especially from a simple to a more complex form"], "examples": [{"text": "the forms of written languages undergo constant evolution"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0338650.012", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "process", "text": "Process"}], "shortDefinitions": ["gradual development"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "development"}, {"language": "en", "text": "advancement"}, {"language": "en", "text": "growth"}, {"language": "en", "text": "rise"}, {"language": "en", "text": "progress"}, {"language": "en", "text": "progression"}, {"language": "en", "text": "expansion"}, {"language": "en", "text": "extension"}, {"language": "en", "text": "unfolding"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "evolution", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0005144.001"}]}, {"definitions": ["the giving off of a gaseous product, or of heat"], "domainClasses": [{"id": "chemistry", "text": "Chemistry"}], "domains": [{"id": "chemistry", "text": "Chemistry"}], "examples": [{"text": "the evolution of oxygen occurs rapidly in this process"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0338650.017", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "chemical_process", "text": "Chemical_Process"}], "shortDefinitions": ["giving off of gaseous product"]}, {"definitions": ["a pattern of movements or maneuvers"], "domainClasses": [{"id": "military", "text": "Military"}], "examples": [{"text": "silk ribbons waving in fanciful evolutions"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0338650.019", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "movement", "text": "Movement"}], "shortDefinitions": ["pattern of movements"]}, {"definitions": ["the extraction of a root from a given quantity."], "domainClasses": [{"id": "mathematics", "text": "Mathematics"}], "domains": [{"id": "mathematics", "text": "Mathematics"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0338650.021", "registers": [{"id": "dated", "text": "Dated"}], "semanticClasses": [{"id": "calculation", "text": "Calculation"}], "shortDefinitions": ["extraction of root from given quantity"]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "evolution"}], "type": "headword", "word": "evolution"}], "word": "evolution"}
