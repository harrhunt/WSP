From the 17th century, the word was appended to names as the official legal description of an unmarried woman: Elizabeth Harris of Boston, Spinster. This type of use survives today only in some legal and religious contexts. In modern everyday English, however, spinster cannot be used to mean simply \u2018unmarried woman\u2019; as such, it is a derogatory term, referring or alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed", "type": "editorialNote"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8spinst\u0259r"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/spinster_us_1.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8sp\u026anst\u0259r"}], "senses": [{"definitions": ["an unmarried woman, typically an older woman beyond the usual age for marriage."], "id": "m_en_gbus0978890.005", "registers": [{"id": "dated", "text": "Dated"}, {"id": "derogatory", "text": "Derogatory"}], "semanticClasses": [{"id": "single_person", "text": "Single_Person"}], "shortDefinitions": ["unmarried woman"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "single"}, {"language": "en", "text": "unattached"}, {"language": "en", "text": "free"}, {"language": "en", "text": "available"}, {"language": "en", "text": "eligible"}, {"language": "en", "text": "young, free, and single"}, {"language": "en", "text": "footloose and fancy free"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "unmarried", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0015587.001"}]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "spinster"}], "type": "headword", "word": "spinster"}], "word": "spinster"}
