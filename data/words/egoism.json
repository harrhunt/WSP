Both words derive from Latin ego (\u2018I\u2019), the first-person singular pronoun. Egotism, the more commonly used term, denotes an excessive sense of self-importance, too-frequent use of the word \u2018I,\u2019 and general arrogance and boastfulness. Egoism, a more subtle term, is perhaps best left to ethicists, for whom it denotes a view or theory of moral behavior in which self-interest is the root of moral conduct. An egoist, then, might devote considerable attention to introspection, but could be modest about it, whereas an egotist would have an exaggerated sense of the importance of his or her self-analysis, and would have to tell everyone", "type": "editorialNote"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8\u0113\u0261\u014d\u02cciz\u0259m"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/egoism_us_2.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8i\u0261o\u028a\u02cc\u026az\u0259m"}], "senses": [{"crossReferenceMarkers": ["another term for egotism"], "crossReferences": [{"id": "egotism", "text": "egotism", "type": "another term for"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0314040.006", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "characteristic", "text": "Characteristic"}], "shortDefinitions": ["fact of being very conceited or absorbed in oneself"], "subsenses": [{"definitions": ["an ethical theory that treats self-interest as the foundation of morality."], "domainClasses": [{"id": "philosophy", "text": "Philosophy"}], "domains": [{"id": "philosophy", "text": "Philosophy"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0314040.008", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "philosophical_doctrine", "text": "Philosophical_Doctrine"}], "shortDefinitions": ["ethical theory that treats self-interest as foundation of morality"]}]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "egoism"}], "type": "headword", "word": "egoism"}], "word": "egoism"}
