Because the use of his in this context is now perceived as sexist by some, a second option became popular: everybody must sign his or her own name.

Although this violates what many consider standard, it is in fact standard in British English and increasingly so in US English. In some sentences, only they makes grammatical sense: everybody agreed to convict the defendant, and they voted unanimously", "type": "editorialNote"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8evr\u0113\u02ccb\u00e4d\u0113"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/everybody_us_3.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8\u025bvri\u02ccb\u0251di"}, {"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8evr\u0113\u02ccb\u0259d\u0113"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/everybody_us_3_rr.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8\u025bvri\u02ccb\u0259di"}], "senses": [{"definitions": ["every person"], "examples": [{"text": "everybody agrees with his views"}, {"text": "it's not everybody's cup of tea"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0338310.007", "shortDefinitions": ["every person"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "everyone"}, {"language": "en", "text": "every person"}, {"language": "en", "text": "each person"}, {"language": "en", "text": "each one"}, {"language": "en", "text": "each and every one"}, {"language": "en", "text": "all"}, {"language": "en", "text": "one and all"}, {"language": "en", "text": "all and sundry"}, {"language": "en", "text": "the whole world"}, {"language": "en", "text": "the world at large"}, {"language": "en", "text": "the public"}, {"language": "en", "text": "the general public"}, {"language": "en", "text": "people everywhere"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "everybody", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0005127.001"}]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "pronoun", "text": "Pronoun"}, "text": "everybody"}], "type": "headword", "word": "everybody"}], "word": "everybody"}
