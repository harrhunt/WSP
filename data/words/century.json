This discrepancy was particularly apparent on January 1, 2000, which was commercially celebrated worldwide as the first day of the 21st century, even though January 1, 2001, was regarded as the more proper date for this milestone. Since the 1st century ran from the year 1 to the year 100, the ordinal number (i.e., second, third, fourth, etc.) used to denote the century will always be one digit higher than the corresponding cardinal digit(s). Thus, 1492 is a date in the 15th century, 1776 is in the 18th century, and so on", "type": "editorialNote"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8sen(t)SH(\u0259)r\u0113"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/century_us_1.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8s\u025bn(t)\u0283(\u0259)ri"}], "senses": [{"definitions": ["a period of one hundred years"], "examples": [{"text": "a century ago most people walked to work"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0164520.006", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "era", "text": "Era"}], "shortDefinitions": ["period of 100 years"], "subsenses": [{"definitions": ["a period of one hundred years reckoned from the traditional date of the birth of Jesus Christ"], "examples": [{"text": "the fifteenth century"}, {"notes": [{"text": "as modifier", "type": "grammaticalNote"}], "text": "a twentieth-century lifestyle"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0164520.009", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "era", "text": "Era"}], "shortDefinitions": ["period used in dating"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "age"}, {"language": "en", "text": "time"}, {"language": "en", "text": "period"}, {"language": "en", "text": "era"}, {"language": "en", "text": "epoch"}, {"language": "en", "text": "century"}, {"language": "en", "text": "decade"}, {"language": "en", "text": "year"}, {"language": "en", "text": "stage"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "date", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0003422.002"}]}]}, {"definitions": ["a score of one hundred in a sporting event, such as a cricket match"], "domainClasses": [{"id": "cricket", "text": "Cricket"}, {"id": "sport", "text": "Sport"}], "examples": [{"text": "he scored the only century of the tour"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0164520.012", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "score", "text": "Score"}], "shortDefinitions": ["score of 100"], "subsenses": [{"definitions": ["a bicycle race of one hundred miles"], "domainClasses": [{"id": "cycling", "text": "Cycling"}], "examples": [{"notes": [{"text": "as modifier", "type": "grammaticalNote"}], "text": "the nation's largest single-day century ride"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0164520.011", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "race", "text": "Race"}], "shortDefinitions": ["bicycle race of one hundred miles"]}]}, {"definitions": ["a company in the ancient Roman army, originally of one hundred men."], "domainClasses": [{"id": "roman_history", "text": "Roman_History"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0164520.014", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "military_unit", "text": "Military_Unit"}], "shortDefinitions": ["company of Roman troops"], "subsenses": [{"definitions": ["an ancient Roman political division for voting."], "domainClasses": [{"id": "roman_history", "text": "Roman_History"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0164520.015", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "administrative_division", "text": "Administrative_Division"}], "shortDefinitions": ["Roman political division"]}]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "century"}], "type": "headword", "word": "century"}], "word": "century"}
