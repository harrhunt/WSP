The advantage over earlier devices was that the second current did not have to come from the tuned circuit, enabling this to operate more efficiently. It differed from the later form of the triode in that it was not capable of linear amplification.", "type": "technicalNote"}], "registers": [{"id": "historical", "text": "Historical"}]}]}], "language": "en-gb", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "audion"}], "type": "headword", "word": "audion"}], "word": "audion"}
