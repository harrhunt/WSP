The rule was formulated on the basis that, since in Latin a preposition cannot come after the word it governs or is linked with, the same should be true of English. What this rule fails to take into account is that English is not like Latin in this respect, and in many cases (particularly in questions and with phrasal verbs) the attempt to move the preposition produces awkward, unnatural-sounding results. Winston Churchill famously objected to the rule, saying \u201cThis is the sort of English up with which I will not put.\u201d In standard English the placing of a preposition at the end of a sentence is widely accepted, provided the use sounds natural and the meaning is clear", "type": "editorialNote"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02ccprep\u0259\u02c8ziSH(\u0259)n"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/preposition_us_1.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02ccpr\u025bp\u0259\u02c8z\u026a\u0283(\u0259)n"}], "senses": [{"definitions": ["a word governing, and usually preceding, a noun or pronoun and expressing a relation to another word or element in the clause, as in \u201cthe man on the platform,\u201d \u201cshe arrived after dinner,\u201d \u201cwhat did you do it for?\u201d."], "domainClasses": [{"id": "grammar", "text": "Grammar"}], "domains": [{"id": "grammar", "text": "Grammar"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0811640.005", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "part_of_speech", "text": "Part_Of_Speech"}], "shortDefinitions": ["word governing, and usually preceding, noun or pronoun and expressing relation to another word or element in clause"]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "preposition"}], "type": "headword", "word": "preposition"}], "word": "preposition"}
