Strictly speaking, this goes against a traditional distinction, by which sensuous is a more neutral term, meaning \u2018relating to the senses rather than the intellect\u2019 (swimming is a beautiful, sensuous experience), while sensual relates to gratification of the senses, especially sexually (a sensual massage). In fact, the word sensuous is thought to have been invented by John Milton (1641) in a deliberate attempt to avoid the sexual overtones of sensual. In practice, the connotations are such that it is difficult to use sensuous in Milton's sense. While traditionalists struggle to maintain a distinction, the evidence suggests that the neutral use of sensuous is rare in modern English. If a neutral use is intended, it is advisable to use alternative wording", "type": "editorialNote"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8sen(t)SH(o\u035eo)\u0259l"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/sensual_us_1.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8s\u025bn(t)\u0283(u)\u0259l"}], "senses": [{"definitions": ["relating to or involving gratification of the senses and physical, especially sexual, pleasure"], "examples": [{"text": "the production of the ballet is sensual and passionate"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0924870.005", "shortDefinitions": ["relating to gratification of senses"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "physical"}, {"language": "en", "text": "physically gratifying"}, {"language": "en", "text": "carnal"}, {"language": "en", "text": "bodily"}, {"language": "en", "text": "fleshly"}, {"language": "en", "text": "animal"}, {"language": "en", "text": "sexually attractive"}, {"language": "en", "text": "sexy"}, {"language": "en", "text": "voluptuous"}, {"language": "en", "text": "sultry"}, {"language": "en", "text": "seductive"}, {"language": "en", "text": "passionate"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "sensual", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0013227.001"}, {"entry_id": "sensual", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0013227.002"}]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "adjective", "text": "Adjective"}, "text": "sensual"}], "type": "headword", "word": "sensual"}], "word": "sensual"}
