Communism embraced a revolutionary ideology in which the state would wither away after the overthrow of the capitalist system. In practice, however, the state grew to control all aspects of communist society. Communism in eastern Europe collapsed in the late 1980s and early 1990s against a background of failure to meet people's economic expectations, a shift to more democracy in political life, and increasing nationalism such as that which led to the breakup of the Soviet Union", "type": "encyclopedicNote"}], "semanticClasses": [{"id": "political_system", "text": "Political_System"}], "shortDefinitions": ["theory or system of social organization in which all property is owned by community and each person contributes and receives according to their ability"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "collectivism"}, {"language": "en", "text": "state ownership"}, {"language": "en", "text": "socialism"}, {"language": "en", "text": "radical socialism"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "communism", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0002615.001"}]}], "variantForms": [{"text": "Communism"}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "communism"}], "type": "headword", "word": "communism"}], "word": "communism"}
