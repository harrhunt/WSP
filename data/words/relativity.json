This states that all motion is relative and that the velocity of light in a vacuum has a constant value that nothing can exceed. Among its consequences are the following: the mass of a body increases and its length (in the direction of motion) shortens as its speed increases; the time interval between two events occurring in a moving body appears greater to a stationary observer; and mass and energy are equivalent and interconvertible. Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915, extended the theory to accelerated motion and gravitation, which was treated as a curvature of the space-time continuum. It predicted that light rays would be deflected and shifted in wavelength when passing through a substantial gravitational field, effects that have been experimentally confirmed", "type": "encyclopedicNote"}], "semanticClasses": [{"id": "natural_phenomenon", "text": "Natural_Phenomenon"}], "shortDefinitions": ["dependence of various physical phenomena on relative motion of observer and observed objects"]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "relativity"}], "type": "headword", "word": "relativity"}], "word": "relativity"}
