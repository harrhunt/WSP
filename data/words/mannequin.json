The source for all four words is the Middle Dutch mannekijn (modern Dutch manneken) \u2018little man,\u2019 \u2018little doll.\u2019 Mannequin is the French spelling from this Dutch source. One of its French meanings, dating from about 1830, is \u2018a young woman hired to model clothes\u2019 (even though the word means \u2018little man\u2019). This sense\u2014still current, but rare in English\u2014first appeared in 1902. The far more common sense of \u2018a life-size jointed figure or dummy used for displaying clothes\u2019 is first recorded in 1939. Manikin has had the sense \u2018little man\u2019 (often contemptuous) since the mid 16th century, when it was sometimes spelled manakin (as it appeared in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, as a term of abuse). Manikin's sense of \u2018an artist's lay figure\u2019 also dates from the mid 16th century (first recorded with the Dutch spelling manneken).To confuse matters further, in modern usage, the words manakin and mannikin refer to birds of two unrelated families. The history of these bird names is somewhat obscure. Manakin may have come from the Portuguese manaquim \u2018mannikin,\u2019 a variant of manequim \u2018mannequin.\u2019 Mannikin may have come directly from the source of the Portuguese words, the Middle Dutch mannekijn", "type": "editorialNote"}], "pronunciations": [{"dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "respell", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8man\u0259k\u0259n"}, {"audioFile": "https://audio.oxforddictionaries.com/en/mp3/mannequin_us_1.mp3", "dialects": ["American English"], "phoneticNotation": "IPA", "phoneticSpelling": "\u02c8m\u00e6n\u0259k\u0259n"}], "senses": [{"definitions": ["a dummy used to display clothes in a store window."], "domainClasses": [{"id": "fashion", "text": "Fashion"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0614810.005", "semanticClasses": [{"id": "dummy", "text": "Dummy"}], "shortDefinitions": ["dummy used to display clothes in shop window"], "subsenses": [{"definitions": ["a person employed by a designer or store to model clothes."], "domainClasses": [{"id": "fashion", "text": "Fashion"}], "id": "m_en_gbus0614810.008", "registers": [{"id": "dated", "text": "Dated"}], "semanticClasses": [{"id": "model", "text": "Model"}], "shortDefinitions": ["person employed to model clothes"], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "model"}, {"language": "en", "text": "fashion model"}, {"language": "en", "text": "supermodel"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "mannequin", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0009160.002"}]}], "synonyms": [{"language": "en", "text": "dummy"}, {"language": "en", "text": "model"}, {"language": "en", "text": "figure"}], "thesaurusLinks": [{"entry_id": "mannequin", "sense_id": "t_en_gb0009160.001"}]}]}], "language": "en-us", "lexicalCategory": {"id": "noun", "text": "Noun"}, "text": "mannequin"}], "type": "headword", "word": "mannequin"}], "word": "mannequin"}
