The error was recorded as early as 1837 and, though common, is unacceptable in standard English. Another controversial issue is the insertion of have where it is superfluous, as for example I might have missed it if you hadn't have pointed it out (rather than the standard \u2026 if you hadn't pointed it out). This construction has been around since at least the 15th and 16th centuries, but only where a hypothetical situation is presented (e.g. statements starting with if). More recently, there has been speculation among grammarians and linguists that this insertion of have may represent a kind of subjunctive and is actually making a useful distinction in the language. However, it is still regarded as an error in standard English.
